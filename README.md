# Voltage-Reader-w-LEDS
This project uses an Arduino Uno to read an analog voltage input and visually display the voltage level of a battery using a row of LEDs. As the voltage increases, more LEDs light up. When the voltage drops below 2.9 volts, all the LEDs begin to flash as a low-voltage warning.
